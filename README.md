Topic: 
Facial recognition data being stored to enhance demographic statistics in a commercial environment.

Description:
	Our project involves creating a dataset based upon demographic information using tools to analyze media. The dataset will be gathered in real time via facial recognition software from a camera. The camera will detect faces of people in sight and gather various demographic data. The software will then populate a database with the gathered data that will include: approximate age, gender, location, and time. As a result, no preloaded dataset will be used; rather, device will be tested in a popular and appropriate setting, such as a classroom or restaurant, to gather test data. The database will store data in real time as well as history of data. A website and webapp will be create to view the data and process the data with various functions. Current functions to implement include: searching, querying, and obtaining various information broken down by various data combinations (such as age breakdown for a specific time); generating graphs and charts of certain data (for example total people detected over time); and setting up email notifications of specified data (such as an end of the day demographic breakdown).  The data recorded will also be organized based on each user such as classroom, restaurant, etc. Therefore a login system will be implemented on the website in which different users only have access to their set of data. 

Purpose:
	Purpose of our project is to provide a tool to gather valuable demographic information. Such information could have various beneficial uses in commercial use. For example, restaurants, department stores, and other commercial businesses can gather information such as gender and age for market research; and classrooms and businesses can gather attendance information.

Technologies:
•	Postgres to store data.
•	Webserver to host website.
•	PHP and HTML to implement website and webapp to view and process data.
•	Custom software using Face++ program to process input and convert to data to be stored.
•	Camera to gather input.

Meetings:
Group meetings to discuss progress and future plans are planned for Sunday afternoons. Lab session time will also be used to discuss project.

Steps to completion:
1)	Map out database layout
2)	Create and setup database 
3)	Create software using Face++ API to populate database based on input
4)	Collect footage to populate the dataset
5)	Setup webserver and website to view data
6)	Add log in function to website
7)	Add various data processing functionalities to website
8)	Add graph generating functionalities to website
9)	Add email notification functionalities to website
10)	Receive A+
