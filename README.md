Topic: Facial recognition being stored used to enhance statistics in a commercial environment.
	We are creating a dataset based upon demographic information using tools to analyze media. The intention is to recognize persons in view of a camera and then record approximate age gender as well as the time and location of the footage. We will create a web directory in order to log in and access these records according to the owners, there will be recordings of recognition, statistical breakdown by demographics, and query by attributes. Visual representation would be available.

Technologies
Postgres, Webserver with PHP, the Face++ program and API documentation

Regular meetings in occurrence on Sunday Afternoons.

Steps to completion:
1)	Set up the database, and interaction with the API
2)	Collect footage to populate the dataset
3)	Create webserver
